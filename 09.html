          it is a representation of "KOPo"

<h5> Private universities established by the government</h5>
<p>It was established in March 2006 by merging a conventional technical college and a vocational college. There are three main courses: the Multifunctional Technician Course (Bachelor of Industry), the Degree Major Advanced Course (Bachelor of Engineering), and the Vocational Training Course. Vocational training courses have a training period of less than one year, such as skilled workers and technical masters, and degrees are not recognized. Education in professional industrial technology is the purpose of the establishment of Korea Polytechnic University. To that end, the departments are almost entirely focused on industrial technology. Since the background of the establishment is the background of the establishment, the character of the vocational training center is stronger than the role as a university. Only students who attend a two-year course are university students (junior colleges), not university students. The one-year course is not for university students, but for vocational training trainees who want to obtain a skilled worker certificate.</p>It was established in March 2006 by merging a conventional technical college and a vocational college.

It is a private university established by the government in a similar case to the Korea University of Technology and Education. On the basis of the National Lifelong Vocational Skills Development Act, the Ministry of Employment and Labor established the corporation.

<h2> School Life</h2>
The atmosphere of the school itself is far from that of a regular university[3]. There are no lectures to the point that it is said that it is the fourth year of high school, the registration for classes is not free, and the schedule is tight. Moreover, the school is so Namcho (...) There are very few contacts between seniors and juniors or even next classes, except for MT, festivals, and lectures in auditoriums, so it is difficult to get to know each other with class leaders, department representatives, student councils, clubs, or each other. The biggest culprit is the task. With the exception of a few students who gave up graduating the same year and beat up, all of them are stuck on assignments for credit/graduation, so it's not easy to talk to each other during assignments. When you enter the school, you immediately realize that this is not a university, but an academy or a vocational school (...) Only the sign is a university! That's why there aren't as many drinking spots as you might think. Kebake, of course. Since graduation credits have been lowered to 4 credits, there is also room on the timetable for the two-year bachelor's program. The mood of each class is determined by the people in the school.
Although it is private like Korea University of Technology and Education, the tuition fee for the two-year course (university course) is very cheap, around 2,1,200 won per semester. [000][4] By the time you graduate, tuition alone is less than 5. Even so, because of the national scholarship highly recommended by professors, depending on the income quartile of each individual, all tuition fees are often filled with scholarships until graduation for the entire two years. In addition, even if you fail the national scholarship examination due to income quartile or lack of credits, the school authorities will support a considerable amount, if not full amount like the national scholarship, in various reasons, and the graduation credits in the two-year program are 500 credits[2] and 2 weeks of classes per academic year[108], which used to be an independent bachelor's system different from that of general vocational colleges, but from 6, it was changed to 36 credits[7]. For reference, the two-year college graduation credit is 2020 credits.
As explained in the technical colleges section, unlike other junior colleges, attendance is very strict. If the tardiness accumulates 2~3 times, it is considered as a one-time absence, and if the absence accumulates 1 times, it is a missing subject. In particular, if you miss even one day of required liberal arts classes, you will not be able to take exams such as midterm exams, and you will be treated as an F (!). [3] Students who cannot graduate because of a lack of credits and must wait the following year for the corresponding classes to fill in the missing credits. In addition, since the purpose is to find a job/work after graduation, job hunting activities begin in earnest in the second half of the second year, and students who are employed within the end of the second year and have worked for more than a certain period of time will be given 9 required credits to be allowed to graduate, and students who are not employed must attend school by the month of graduation ceremony of the following year to graduate.
3.3. Distant senior-junior relationships[edit]
Some departments may experience military-like military flags, but in practice there are very few. [10] They are just close brothers, older sisters, older brothers, older sisters, and younger brothers. There is no contact other than academic events such as MT. Even in departments with a small number of people, seniors and juniors may play together. Some colleges have deans who are former military (officers), so if students are caught by the dean while casting a poop flag, the dean will kill them himself. [11] First- and second-graders are even treated as each other. In a word, it's a little freer, and you go to a tighter high school. By the standards of the metropolitan area, there is almost no military flag among seniors and juniors. Whether you're older, more experienced, or have good grades, it feels even more so because it's the engineering college system that the one who gets a better job wins anyway. In addition, due to the nature of the polytechnic, the age group is higher than other schools, and most of them respect each other because they know the relationship between social life and general universities.
3.4. timetable[edit]
<hr>
<h4> Distant senior-junior relationships</h4>
<p>Polytechnics cannot specify timetables at the discretion of students. [12][13] Timetables are all set by the department. The extended one-day lecture schedule of vocational high schools is very tight. There will be differences by subject, but it is better in the first semester, but in the second semester, the lectures can be very long due to assignments, extended lectures, etc. From morning to evening, if there is a lecture due to the professor's circumstances and reinforcement is scheduled, the lecture may be held until the night. In addition, online lectures for each subject are also required. Students who are bothered may simply ignore it. And at the end of the semester, I cut a lot of credits, and most of them regret it. (...) For English subjects, you need to take two tests: offline tests and online tests conducted on external sites. [1]

    In fact, it is common to register for courses in the classroom as a group after the course starts.</p>
